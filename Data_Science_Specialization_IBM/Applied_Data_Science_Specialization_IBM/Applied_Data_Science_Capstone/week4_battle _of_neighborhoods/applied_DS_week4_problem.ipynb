    "Moving to a new city can be quite overwhelming, especially for young families. Parents want their children to grow up in a protected environment yet with a lot of freedom for their development. Often times, families move to a city which provides a lot of opportunities, most of all career opportunities. Larger cities consist of many districts and neighborhoods which may differ strongly in regard to venues and age of citizens. The age of citizens is being considered based on the assumption that young families want to be among themselves, meet other young parents and want their children to make many friends. \n",
