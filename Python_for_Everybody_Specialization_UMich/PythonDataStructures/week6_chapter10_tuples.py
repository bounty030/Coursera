#week 6 - chapter 10 - tuples

#A tuple1 is a sequence of values much like a list. 
# The values stored in a tuple can be any type, and they are indexed by 
# integers.

"""
t = ("a", "b", "c")
print(t[1])

#o create a tuple with a single element, you have to include 
# the final comma:
t1 = ("a",)
print(type(t1))

#without the comma at the end it is a string
t2=("a")
print(type(t2))

#you cannot modify one of the elements of a tuple
#but you can replace a tuple with another
t3 = t + t1
print(t3)

#tuple assignment
"""
m = ["have", "fun"]

"""

#when to use tuples?

#1. In some contexts, like areturnstatement, it is syntactically simpler 
# to createa tuple than a list. In other contexts, you might prefer a list.

#2. If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an 
# immutable type like a tuple or string.

#3. If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using 
# tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.

#Because tuples are immutable, they donâ€™t provide methods like
# "sort" and "reverse",which modify existing lists.
